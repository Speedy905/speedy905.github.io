		My Name is Antonio Karlo Mijares. I am currently a 
		Seneca College Student, studying Computer Systems Technology.
		This is a side project. I plan to build this from time to time,
		with changes that can happen in a day or a month. In the meantime,
		you can <a href="mailto:AK.Mijares99@gmail.com">contact me</a> and 
		I'll try to answer you when I can. Thanks!
