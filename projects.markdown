      alt: Email server
    description: A custom email server. I've wanted to experiment on server hosting, especially on a VPS, so I've decided to buy a virtual instance on Vultr, and followed <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/emailwiz">Luke Smith's script</a>, which resulted in a working email server. An email server wasn't exactly my first choice, but it was interesting to tackle upon

    description: A backup and restore for qcow2 files. Inspired from one of my courses, since I deal with Virtual machines with virt-manager alot, I wanted an easier way to backup and restore my virtual machines without having to type out commands one by one.

    description: Using Arch as a primary operating system. With my basic Linux knowledge that I've acquired over the years, I wanted to experiment/play around with it more, which lead me to the installation of Arch Linux. My current laptop, a hand-me-down t430s has Arch Linux installed.

    description: My first PC build. With the knowledge that I received about PC building, I wanted to apply that knowledge into actually doing it. With the success of it, it brought me to where I am, fascinated on technology and computers. It ran on a I5-4590, paired with a R9 380 GPU.
